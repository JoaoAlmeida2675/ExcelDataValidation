1. **Function `get_column_index_from_letter`:**
   - **Objective:** This function converts a letter or set of letters to uppercase and calculates the corresponding column index, where A=1, B=2, etc.
   - **Parameters:** Receives a string `letter`.
   - **Process:**
     - Converts the letter to uppercase.
     - Initializes a string `alphabet` with the letters of the alphabet.
     - Initializes `column_index` as zero.
     - Iterates over each character in the provided letter.
     - Calculates the corresponding index in the alphabet and updates `column_index` by multiplying it by 26 (number of letters in the alphabet) and adding the character index.
   - **Result:** Returns the column index.

2. **Function `inclusive_range`:**
   - **Objective:** This function generates a range including the end value.
   - **Parameters:** Receives `start` and `end`.
   - **Process:** Returns a range from `start` to `end + 1`.

3. **Open Excel and Load the File:**
   - **Objective:** Initiates an instance of Excel using openpyxl and opens an Excel workbook from the specified path.
   - **Process:**
     - Creates an instance of Excel using `openpyxl.load_workbook`.
     - Checks if the workbook was opened successfully.
     - Specifies the sheet name as `"your\sheet\name"`.
     - Selects the sheet by name.
     - Specifies the columns and rows to check.
   - **Result:** `excel` contains the Excel instance, and `sheet` contains the selected sheet.

4. **Check Empty Cells:**
   - **Objective:** Iterates over the specified columns and rows to check if the cells are empty.
   - **Process:**
     - Initializes a list to store empty column names.
     - Loops through specified columns and rows.
     - Checks for null values and adds messages to the list for empty columns.
   - **Result:** A list `empty_column_names` contains messages for empty columns.

5. **Create the .txt File with Messages for Empty Columns:**
   - **Objective:** Creates a text file with messages for empty columns.
   - **Process:**
     - Specifies the path of the text file.
     - Uses `open` and `write` to create the file and write messages to it.
   - **Result:** A text file, "MissingDataExcel.txt," is created with messages for empty columns.
